# Authentication Persistence Fix

## Problem
When refreshing the account page, users were being logged out unexpectedly. This was caused by several issues in the authentication flow:

1. **Race condition**: The account page was redirecting users before the auth state was fully initialized
2. **Token verification timing**: Token verification was happening before the auth context was ready
3. **Missing loading states**: No proper loading state while auth was being initialized
4. **Insufficient error handling**: Auth failures weren't handled gracefully

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced Auth Context Initialization
- Added proper loading state management
- Improved token refresh logic with 5-minute buffer
- Added fallback token verification
- Better error handling for malformed auth data

### 2. Improved Account Page Logic
- Wait for auth state to be fully loaded before making decisions
- Added loading state while auth is being initialized
- Better error handling for 401 responses
- Proper dependency array for useEffect

### 3. Robust Token Management
- Multiple refresh attempts before giving up
- Graceful handling of expired tokens
- Automatic redirect to login on auth failures

## Key Changes

### Auth Context (`lib/auth-context.tsx`)
- Enhanced `initializeAuth` function with better error handling
- Added 5-minute buffer for token refresh
- Multiple refresh attempts for better reliability
- Proper validation of auth data structure

### Account Page (`app/account/page.tsx`)
- Added loading state while auth is being initialized
- Wait for `authState.isLoading` to be false before making decisions
- Better error handling for API calls
- Automatic redirect on authentication failures

## Testing

The fix ensures that:
1. Users stay logged in when refreshing the account page
2. Loading states are properly displayed
3. Authentication failures are handled gracefully
4. Token refresh happens automatically when needed

## Usage

Users can now:
- Refresh the account page without being logged out
- See proper loading states during authentication
- Experience seamless token refresh
- Get redirected to login only when truly necessary
