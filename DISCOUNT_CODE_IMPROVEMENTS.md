# Discount Code Validation Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the discount code validation system to provide specific, actionable error messages instead of generic "Invalid discount code" responses.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Messages for Buy X Get Y Discounts

**Before:** Generic "Invalid discount code" message
**After:** Specific messages like:
- "Add 2 more items to your cart to apply this discount (Buy 3 Get 1 Free)"
- "Add 1 more item to get the next free item (Buy 3 Get 1 Free)"

### 2. Improved Minimum Order Amount Validation

**Before:** "Minimum order amount of 500 required"
**After:** "Add 150.00 EGP more to your cart to apply this discount (minimum order: 500 EGP)"

### 3. Better Empty Cart Handling

**Before:** Generic error for buyXgetX discounts with empty cart
**After:** "Add items to your cart to apply this discount"

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

- Discount code input is automatically cleared when validation fails
- Users can easily retry with corrected cart contents
- Clear guidance on what actions to take
- **Error messages appear right after the discount code field** (not at the top of the page)
- Error messages automatically clear when user starts typing a new code

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. `app/api/discount-codes/validate/route.ts` - Enhanced validation logic
2. `app/checkout/page.tsx` - Improved error handling and UX
3. `app/api/test-functionality/route.ts` - Added validation testing

### Key Features:
- **Quantity-based validation**: Checks if cart has enough items for buyXgetX discounts
- **Progressive feedback**: Tells users exactly how many more items they need
- **Amount-based validation**: Shows remaining amount needed for minimum order requirements
- **Comprehensive error handling**: Covers all discount types and edge cases
- **Contextual error display**: Discount errors appear right after the discount code field
- **Auto-clearing errors**: Error messages clear when user starts typing new codes

## Testing

The system now includes automated testing for discount validation:
- Tests insufficient items scenarios
- Validates error message specificity
- Ensures proper API responses

## Usage Examples

### Buy 3 Get 1 Free Discount:
- **Cart has 2 items**: "Add 1 more item to your cart to apply this discount (Buy 3 Get 1 Free)"
- **Cart has 5 items**: "Add 1 more item to get the next free item (Buy 3 Get 1 Free)"

### Minimum Order Amount:
- **Cart total: 350 EGP, Minimum: 500 EGP**: "Add 150.00 EGP more to your cart to apply this discount (minimum order: 500 EGP)"

### Empty Cart:
- **BuyXgetX discount with empty cart**: "Add items to your cart to apply this discount"
